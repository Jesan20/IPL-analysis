IPL SQL Project:
This project focuses on querying and analyzing the IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset using SQL. The dataset contains information about matches and deliveries in various IPL seasons. Using SQL, this project answers key queries related to team performances, player statistics, match outcomes, and more.

Dataset Overview
The IPL dataset is divided into two main tables:

Matches: Contains details about each IPL match, including match id, season, date, teams, venue, winner, and more.
Deliveries: Contains ball-by-ball details of each match, including batsman, bowler, runs scored, extras, dismissals, and more.

I have shared the dataset and the word file for the questions which I have answered in project SQL file.
